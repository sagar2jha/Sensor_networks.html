# Sensor_networks.html
This repository contains a small project based on a simple sensor network.The network uses ESP8266 for both the AP and STA mode and can connect upto 8 sensors if the ESP8266 itself is used as a hotspot or as many sensors if it is connected to some external routing device.The code displays the data recorded by the sensors over a webpage with the graphs which can be used for further analysis if data logging is done properly(not a part of this project).However we have just used 4 sensors (DHT11 temp and humidity sensor, IR sensor , Water level sensor , rain detection sensor).
